Introduction

The primary objective of this project is to understand how different religious compositions of a population correlate with various crime rates. This includes examining data for different religions such as Islam, Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism, and non-religious groups.

**Data**

The dataset used in this analysis contains information on:

Kidnappings per 100,000 people
Robberies per 100,000 people
Murders per 100,000 people
Assaults per 100,000 people
Burglaries per 100,000 people
Other relevant crime statistics
These data points are segmented by year and country, alongside the religious composition of the population.

**Setup**

To run the analysis, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
Analysis

The analysis involves several key steps:

Data Loading and Cleaning:

Load the data into a pandas DataFrame.
Check for and handle any missing values.
Data Filtering:

Filter the data for the range of 2005-2017 to ensure consistency.
Categorization by Religion:

Define thresholds for categorizing countries based on the percentage of the population adhering to different religions.
Plot the average crime rates for these categories to visualize potential correlations.
Plotting:

Generate bar plots to compare average crime rates across different religious compositions.
Results

The results section contains various plots and analyses showing the relationship between the religious composition of a country's population and its crime rates. Each religious group is analyzed separately, and the crime rates are compared across different categories.

**Conclusion**

The conclusion summarizes the findings and provides insights into the correlations between religious composition and crime rates. It also discusses potential implications and areas for further research.
